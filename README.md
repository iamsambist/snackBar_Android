Besides displaying a message, a Snackbar in Android can perform the following basic actions:

Display a Call-to-Action Button: Snackbars can include an optional action button, allowing the user to respond to the message (e.g., undo an action, retry a process, or navigate to a different screen).

Auto-dismiss after a Timeout: Snackbars automatically disappear after a short period (typically 4-7 seconds), unless dismissed manually.

Swipe to Dismiss: Users can swipe to manually dismiss the Snackbar before it automatically disappears.

Handle User Input: The Snackbar can trigger events or actions based on the button click or when it is dismissed by the user, allowing you to respond to user interactions programmatically.
